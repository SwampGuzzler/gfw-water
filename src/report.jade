          The quantity and quality of water sources, and hence the cost to transport and treat water, depend heavily on the health of the source watershed. Healthy forested lands provide critical watershed functions as <strong>nautural infrastructure</strong>:  they minimize erosion and pollutants, purify water, and reduce the impact of floods and droughts.

              Over the last several centuries, vast forest areas have been cleared as agriculture has spread and human populations have grown. Breaking the spiral of loss and degradation and restoring these lands would bring many benefits. Restored lands help support livelihoods and biodiversity by supplying clean water, reducing erosiion, providing wildlife habitat, buifuel, and other forest products. Forests and trees mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon. Trees in agricultural landscapes can enhance soil fertility, onserve soil moisture, and boost food production.

            p.emphasis.
              Erosion is a significant problem that affects both water quantity and quality. High erosion deteriorates water quality and reduces capacity of reservoirs, increasing cost of water treatment and capital expenses and damaging safety of water supplies. High erosion risk is usually linked to erodible soil, intense rainfall, steep topography, and conversion of forest and other natural land covers to pasture or cropland and other human activities.

              Uninvited wildfires are common in some watershed and are a natural form of disturbance in forests. Fire can provide long-term benefits to forest and watershed health. But high intensity or large wild fires can result in significant increases in runoff and erosion, which can negatively impact water quality.
